	abstract     = {Cities will be exposed to a substantial increase in extreme weather events as global warming continues, thereby affecting the microclimate they create for their citizens. The microclimate in cities is shaped by the built environment, proposed and developed by architects and urban designers, and constrained by the zoning rules imposed by urban planners. These stakeholders go through a design process where the most impactful changes can only be made very early on; however, for those specific stakeholders, there are currently no computational tools to estimate the microclimatic impact of their designs at this crucial stage in early design. This thesis introduces a decoupled approach to simulating outdoor thermal comfort, motivated by global sensitivity analyses. For this, computational fluid dynamics and ray tracing processes are streamlined and validated, which are required to simulate the wind velocity and mean radiant temperature in urban areas. Further, a surrogate model driven by a generative adversarial network is introduced, demonstrating near-instantaneous performance feedback in very early design. In three case studies, the contributions are used in practice to (1) engage in building-scale architectural design, (2) run parametric studies and optimization for urban design, and (3) inform city-scale urban policy. In conclusion, the latest machine learning techniques and the opportunities they provide will revolutionize the way we engage with environmental performance simulation in the urban design process.},

	abstract     = {With increased awareness of sustainability, natural ventilation has become a strategy to reduce energy consumption in the built environment while providing comfortable indoor air quality. Themain aim of this thesis was to apply the CFD software OpenFOAM, to investigate the wind-induced natural ventilation potential of classrooms. Relevant ventilation metrics such as air change rates, age of air, and CO2 concentrationswere implemented. External and internal wind flows were simulated in one domain to assess the natural ventilation potential via RANS turbulence modeling. A case setup for a simple cross-ventilation geometry was validated against wind tunnel measurements in accordance with CFD guidelines for the built environment. Based on the validation, a case study was conducted for BRAC University—located in subtropical Asia. The validation study revealed that OpenFOAM was able to accurately predict the flow field and flow rates for the cross-ventilation geometry. Further, OpenFOAM’s passive scalar transport method is able to predict CO2 concentrations with a reasonable error range, while the work-flow can be highly automated. Applying these results to the case study, we suggest a number of geometry modifications to optimize the natural ventilation potential of classrooms for BRAC University. These include specific placement based on the wind direction, and either relocation or shape optimization of adjacent staircases. Additionally, we suggest the use of operable windows to accommodate temporal fluctuations throughout the year. Finally, passive scalar transport methods, which derive metrics like the age of air or CO2 concentrations, provide additional valuable information that should not be overlooked when evaluating design principles. In the future, it may be possible to employ tools based on the implemented ventilation metrics to automate the search for optimized building geometries for maximizing the natural ventilation potential.},

Different researches  showed that one can affect and control the wafer quality by varying the process parameters.  In this work, four ribbon wafers with obvious structural differences were analysed in terms of  their electrical and structural specifics. Two of the four wafers were reference samples, which  were produced with common growth parameters. In addition, one wafer with significant  large grains was investigated. The last ribbon apparently showed extensive twin regions in  the boundary areas.  The ribbons were analysed in terms of etch pit density, minority charge carrier  lifetime, grain orientation, solid/liquid interface and local thickness variations.},
