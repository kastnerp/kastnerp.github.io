Patrick Kastner is a systems engineer passionate about empowering people by finding, implementing & scaling solutions to systemic problems.

His expertise is in environmental modeling to inform the multi-objective decision making of architects and urban planners. His current project is [Eddy3D](https://www.eddy3d.com/), a performance-driven design toolkit to predict outdoor thermal comfort in cities. Eddy3D is currently used at KPF, Henning Larsen, Gensler, and Foster & Partners, and by researchers and educators at institutions including the TU Munich, AIT, ETH, MIT, UPenn, University of Toronto, Harvard, and Cornell.

He holds a M.S. in [Systems Engineering](https://www.systemseng.cornell.edu/se/programs/systems-ms-degree) from Cornell, a M.Sc. in [Sustainable Building Science](https://www.bgu.tum.de/en/enpb/home) from TU Munich, and a B.Sc. in [Energy Engineering](https://www.et.studium.fau.de/) from FAU Erlangen-Nuremberg. While completing his M.Sc., he joined the [Technology Management](https://www.cdtm.de/cdtm_team/patrick-kastner/) program at the Center for Digital Technology and Management (CDTM) and led operations at [TEDxTUM](https://www.tedxtum.com/), helping to organize four major events around Munich that hosted 1500+ attendees.

Patrick Kastner is a Postdoctoral Associate with the Environmental System Lab at Cornell AAP, specializing in environmental performance simulation and the decarbonization of buildings and cities. He earned his Ph.D. and M.S. in [Systems Science and Engineering](https://www.systemseng.cornell.edu/se/programs/systems-ms-degree) from Cornell University. During his doctoral research, he developed [Eddy3D](https://www.eddy3d.com/), a microclimate modeling software toolkit for Rhino & Grasshopper, now adopted by leading institutions in both academia and practice.

After completing his Ph.D., Kastner joined Cornell AAP as a postdoctoral associate, where he provided decision support for the Ithaca Green New Deal to accelerate efforts to decarbonize Ithaca's building stock until 2030.

Originally from Germany, Kastner holds a M.S. in [Sustainable Building Science](https://www.bgu.tum.de/en/enpb/home) from TU Munich, and a B.S. in [Energy Engineering](https://www.et.studium.fau.de/) from FAU Erlangen-Nuremberg. While in Munich, he was fortunate enough to study at the [Center for Digital Technology and Management](https://www.cdtm.de/cdtm_team/patrick-kastner/) and enjoyed his time leading the operations team at [TEDxTUM](https://www.tedxtum.com/).
