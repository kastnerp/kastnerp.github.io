I am passionate about empowering people by finding, implementing & scaling solutions to systemic problems.

Currently, I am interested in environmental modeling to inform the multi-objective decision-making of architects and urban planners. In my postdoctoral role, I provide decision support for the [City of Ithaca](https://www.cityofithaca.org/642/Green-New-Deal) to accelerate efforts to decarbonize its building stock until 2030. I am also the lead developer of [Eddy3D](https://www.eddy3d.com), a performance-driven design toolkit that predicts outdoor thermal comfort in cities that is used by leading institutions in academia and practice.

I hold a Ph.D. and M.S. in [Systems Science and Engineering](https://www.systemseng.cornell.edu/se/programs/systems-phd) from Cornell, a M.S. in [Sustainable Building Science](https://www.cee.ed.tum.de/en/enpb/study-and-teaching/study-programs/resource-efficient-and-sustainable-building/) from TU Munich, and a B.S. in [Energy Engineering](https://www.et.studium.fau.de) from FAU Erlangen-Nuremberg. During my time in Munich, I also studied [Technology Management](https://www.cdtm.de/cdtm_team/patrick-kastner/) at the Center for Digital Technology and Management (CDTM) and led operations at [TEDxTUM](https://www.tedxtum.com/), helping to organize four major events that hosted 1500+ attendees.
