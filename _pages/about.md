I am passionate about empowering people by finding, implementing & scaling solutions to systemic problems.

Currently, I am interested in environmental modeling to inform the multi-objective decision-making of architects and urban planners. My current project is [Eddy3D](https://www.eddy3d.com), a performance-driven design toolkit to predict outdoor thermal comfort in cities.
Eddy3D is currently used at KPF, Henning Larsen, Gensler, and Foster + Partners, and by researchers and educators at institutions including the TU Munich, AIT, ETH, MIT, UPenn, University of Toronto, Harvard, and Cornell.

I hold a M.S. in [Systems Engineering](https://www.systemseng.cornell.edu/se/programs/systems-ms-degree) from Cornell, a M.S. in [Sustainable Building Science](https://www.cee.ed.tum.de/en/enpb/study-and-teaching/study-programs/resource-efficient-and-sustainable-building/) from TU Munich, and a B.S. in [Energy Engineering](https://www.et.studium.fau.de) from FAU Erlangen-Nuremberg. While completing my Master's, I also studied [Technology Management](https://www.cdtm.de/cdtm_team/patrick-kastner/) at the Center for Digital Technology and Management (CDTM) in Munich and led operations at [TEDxTUM](https://www.tedxtum.com/), helping to organize four major events around Munich that hosted 1500+ attendees.
