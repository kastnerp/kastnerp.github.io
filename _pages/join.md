Thank you for your interest in working with me. I receive a fair number of inquiries from prospective students every week, and have put together this page to provide more information.

You can start working with me in a number of ways, depending on whether you are a Georgia Tech (GT) student or external to GT.

### External to GT

If you are external to GT, and would like to join GT to work with me, you can either apply for the [M.S. in Architecture](https://arch.gatech.edu/master-science-architecture) or [Ph.D. in Architecture](https://arch.gatech.edu/phd-architecture). *Please note that admission decisions are made by an admissions comittee and not by myself*.

Before submitting an official GT application, you are welcome to reach out to me beforehand to make sure there is a fit. Instead of approaching me with a cover letter, please use [this form](https://forms.gle/YGa9cNqTumaREhF16) to get in touch with me.


### Student at GT

If you are a current student at Georgia Tech and would like to join my group, I ask you to complete one semester as part of my [Vertically Integrated Project (VIP)](/teaching/gt-vip-vyh/).

Please refer to the official VIP program information on how to join my VIP as an [undergraduate](https://vip.gatech.edu/apply-undergraduate-students) or [grad student](https://vip.gatech.edu/graduate-students). There are options to join the class as 1-3 credit hours, depending on your level of seniority at GT.
