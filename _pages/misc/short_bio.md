Patrick Kastner is a systems engineer passionate about empowering people by finding, implementing & scaling solutions to systemic problems.

His expertise is in environmental modeling to inform the multi-objective decision making of architects and urban planners. His current project is [Eddy3D](https://www.eddy3d.com/), a performance-driven design toolkit to predict outdoor thermal comfort in cities. Eddy3D is currently used at KPF, Henning Larsen, Gensler, and Foster & Partners, and by researchers and educators at institutions including the TU Munich, AIT, ETH, MIT, UPenn, University of Toronto, Harvard, and Cornell.

He holds a M.S. in [Systems Engineering](https://www.systemseng.cornell.edu/se/programs/systems-ms-degree) from Cornell, a M.Sc. in [Sustainable Building Science](https://www.bgu.tum.de/en/enpb/home) from TU Munich, and a B.Sc. in [Energy Engineering](https://www.et.studium.fau.de/) from FAU Erlangen-Nuremberg. While completing his M.Sc., he joined the [Technology Management](https://www.cdtm.de/cdtm_team/patrick-kastner/) program at the Center for Digital Technology and Management (CDTM) and led operations at [TEDxTUM](https://www.tedxtum.com/), helping to organize four major events around Munich that hosted 1500+ attendees.

Patrick Kastner is a Postdoctoral Associate with the Environmental System Lab at Cornell AAP, specializing in environmental performance simulation and the decarbonization of buildings and cities. He earned his Ph.D. and M.S. in [Systems Science and Engineering](https://www.systemseng.cornell.edu/se/programs/systems-ms-degree) from Cornell University. During his doctoral research, he developed [Eddy3D](https://www.eddy3d.com/), a microclimate modeling software toolkit for Rhino & Grasshopper, now adopted by leading institutions in both academia and practice.

After completing his Ph.D., Kastner joined Cornell AAP as a postdoctoral associate, where he provided decision support for the Ithaca Green New Deal to accelerate efforts to decarbonize Ithaca's building stock until 2030.

Originally from Germany, Kastner holds a M.S. in [Sustainable Building Science](https://www.bgu.tum.de/en/enpb/home) from TU Munich, and a B.S. in [Energy Engineering](https://www.et.studium.fau.de/) from FAU Erlangen-Nuremberg. While in Munich, he was fortunate enough to study at the [Center for Digital Technology and Management](https://www.cdtm.de/cdtm_team/patrick-kastner/) and enjoyed his time leading the operations team at [TEDxTUM](https://www.tedxtum.com/).

Dr. Kastner is an Assistant Professor at the School of Architecture at Georgia Tech, where he directs the Sustainable Urban Systems Lab. The lab focuses on building performance modeling and develops software tools to inform the architectural design process. He is the lead developer of Eddy3D, a Computational Fluid Dynamics toolkit capable of simulation indoor and outdoor airflow of buildings, now adopted by leading institutions in both academia and practice. Eddy3D to date was downloaded over 120k times and led to numerous publications including studies on how space planning strategies might help in reducing viral spread in commercial environments. Dr. Kastner's research has been funded by the Cornell Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future, the Georgia Tech Brook Byers Institute for Sustainable Systems, and is supported by the Ray C. Anderson Foundation in Atlanta, GA. He holds a Ph.D. and M.S. in Systems Science and Engineering from Cornell University, and an M.S. in Sustainable Building Science from TU Munich.
