📢 I am excited to share that I joined the faculty at the Georgia Tech School of Architecture as an Assistant Professor! 🏛️

During my journey at Cornell Systems Engineering and Cornell University College of Architecture, Art, and Planning, I was continually drawn to the potential Systems tools would have when applied to the field of architecture. The built environment faces many challenges in the coming decades, and I am excited to contribute with software tools that place sustainability at the forefront of the profession.

I would also like to take this opportunity to thank my mentors, family, and friends. I am particularly thankful to have Timur Dogan, Oliver Gao, Martin Miller, Derek Cabrera, and Lisa Kaltenegger as my supporters and mentors.

As I start this new chapter, I look forward to continuing my collaborations with my colleagues at TUM, Technion, MIT, Cornell, and of course, to establishing new ones at the Georgia Tech High Performance Building Lab - HPBL, Georgia Tech, Atlanta, and beyond.

If you (or someone you know) are interested in working with me, please reach out. I will be recruiting students and post-docs this fall. More news to follow in the coming weeks…
