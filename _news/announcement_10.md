I was invited to serve as a panelist at the  2022 Cornell [Systems Thinking]( https://blogs.cornell.edu/systemsthinking/conference/) conference. My colleagues and I will be discussing the analytical and synthetic power of DSRP structural predictions on innovation and discovery as well as how they might minimize cognitive bias.
